Setting up the Rock Band 2 Deluxe repo for the first time is meant to be as easy as possible.
As well, it is designed to allow you to automatically receive updates as the repo is updated.

Simply go to the Releases of this repo and grab all three files. (two .exe, one .bat, .sh for linux)

The two exe's are a couple dependencies, [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), and [Dot Net 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime).
Git is required for you to take advantage of auto updating via github pulls. Dot Net is required to build an ARK file, the archive format the game needs to run.
You can setup git with all default options, same with dot net.

Once the dependencies are installed, run "_init_repo.bat" in an **empty folder**. git will pull the repo and make sure you are completely up to date.

From then on simply run "_build_ps3.bat" or "_build_xbox.bat", depending on the platform you are building for. This script will pull the repo again for updates, and build the ARK for you and spit it out in _build/Xbox or _build/PS3

On ps3/rpcs3, copy all files in "_build/ps3/" to "/dev_hdd0/game/BLUS30147/"
Match the file system and overwrite the files.

On Xbox, copy the gen folder and the xex from "_build/xbox/" to the location you have installed Rock Band 2.

Make sure you clear your song cache, as well as your system cache.

To clear song cache, navigate to Storage>Rock Band 3> and delete the song cache.

To clear system cache, navigate to Storage, and press Y to clear the system cache.

If installing for the first time, make sure you rename the vanilla "default.xex" to "default_vanilla.xex" for safety.

Also make sure to disable any enabled updates for Rock Band 2 in Aurora. Rock Band 2 deluxe rolls TU6 into its base installation.

Run the build script again to pull any new updates committed to the repo and rebuild a new ark.

## Songs

You can find song packs compatible with all Rock Band titles for both platforms on the [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-3lo2ASxM-3yVr_JH14F7-Lc1v2_FcS5Rv_yDCANEmk/edit#gid=0).


You can also use [Onyx Music Game Toolkit](https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs) to generate your own custom song packs for Rock Band games.
